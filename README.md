# AttendanceManagerMonster

## The rationale behind it

On Aug 2015 "she codes;" launched "she codes; Academy" - free-of-charge Web and Android study tracks for women without any previous programming background. The need for well designed software which automatically sends tasks and monitors the students progress arose in the very first day of "she codes; academy".

AttendanceManagerMonster is a GUI app for managers is used:

1. To analyse students progress.
2. To send weekly emails to students.
3. Modify attendance files

and more...

It was created for "she codes;" WIS branch on Feb 8, 2016. AttendanceManagerMonster and TasksMonster applications were the source of inspiration for shecodesconnect.com - implementation of this platform at national level.

## The application

AttendanceManagerMonster application was built in Anaconda Python 3.5 on windows. As soon as time permits I will upload a new version with related files so that the software will work on any PC.
